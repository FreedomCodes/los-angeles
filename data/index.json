Together with js.la, we are inviting you to come out and join the hackathoh. CAA NodeBots Day is a meetup for JavaScript enthusiasts and hardware hackers of all skill levels to come together, collaborate, and play with the latest and greatest hardware. NodeBots are robots powered by Node.js and JavaScript but can often include software in a variety of languages. They are a great way to learn both JavaScript and hardware concepts alike. You can find out more about NodeBots at: http://www.nodebots.io Johnny-Five is a great place to get started if you want to get familiar before the event, and this is what NodeSchool Los Angeles will be covering for the event. Come join us and play with some Tessel 2's, Raspberry Pi's, Arduinos, and more and learn something new!</p>",
